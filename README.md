# MAD Practical 3 : Create an android application which demonstrates implicit and explicit intent

## Overview

The Android Utility App is a multi-functional application designed to enhance the user experience by offering a variety of useful features. This app provides seamless access to several native functionalities of an Android device, making it a one-stop solution for frequently used operations such as browsing the web, accessing the gallery, viewing the call log, opening the camera, setting alarms, making phone calls, and logging in through a custom login form.

## Key Features

1. **Open Browser**: The app allows users to input a URL and open it in the device's default web browser. If the URL doesn't start with `http://` or `https://`, the app automatically formats the URL for the user.

2. **Access the Gallery**: With just a tap of a button, users can open the device's gallery to view their photos and videos.

3. **Launch the Camera**: The app enables quick access to the device's camera, allowing users to take photos or record videos instantly.

4. **View Call Log**: Users can easily access their call history to view recent incoming, outgoing, and missed calls.

5. **Set Alarms**: The app opens the device's alarm app, giving users the ability to view and manage their alarms directly.

6. **Make Phone Calls**: Users can enter a phone number and initiate a call directly from the app with a single tap.

7. **Browse Links in Browser**: The app allows users to enter any web link and browse it through the default browser.

8. **Custom Login Form**: The app includes a simple login form that lets users securely log in. This can be used for authentication or as a gateway to other features within the app.

## How It Works

- **Input URL and Browse**: The app includes an input field where users can enter a URL. Once entered, pressing the button will open the URL in the default web browser. It ensures that the URL is correctly formatted and checks if a compatible app is installed to handle the request.

- **Access Gallery and Camera**: With dedicated buttons, users can instantly launch their gallery or camera apps to view media or capture photos and videos.

- **View Call Log**: A simple tap will allow the user to view their recent call logs directly.

- **Set and Manage Alarms**: The app connects to the native alarm clock functionality, allowing users to manage their alarms without leaving the app.

- **Make Phone Calls**: Users can input any phone number in the text field and initiate a call by pressing the "Call" button.

- **Login Form**: The app includes a simple login form where users can enter their credentials.
